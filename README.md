# Awsome_Notebooks Gravitational Graph
Graph visualization of awsome_notebooks data

For new data in JSON format you can use the notebook Pyvis_visualization.ipynb and change the name of the .json file to import new data.

 ...or run the following script in the terminal:

### Usage of the pyvis_naas.py: 
```shell
python pyvis_nass.py yourdatafile.json
```

Here I am using "ForceAtlas2based" for the movement physics model. In my opinion "barnesHut" and "ForceAtlas2based" are the most interesting gravitational models for nodes with this kind of network.
